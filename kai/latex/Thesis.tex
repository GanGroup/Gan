\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr Serhiy Yanchuk, 
for his invaluable guidance, continuous support, and insightful feedback throughout the 
course of my research. His expertise and encouragement have been instrumental in the 
successful completion of this thesis.

\begin{abstract}
    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a pivotal tool in the field of generative modeling, 
    offering a novel approach to generating realistic data through the adversarial training of a generator 
    and a discriminator. This thesis investigates the performance of GANs in generating high-quality images, 
    with a particular focus on the challenges associated with model structure, training stability, and evaluation metrics.
    
    In this study, I employed the Animal Faces-HQ (AFHQ) dataset, consisting of 16,130 high-resolution images, 
    to train a standard GAN model aimed at generating realistic cat images. The research explored the impact of
     various architectural choices, including the use of convolutional layers versus dense layers, as well as 
     the effects of data augmentation techniques on model performance. The experiments revealed that convolutional 
     architectures significantly outperformed dense ones, highlighting the importance of spatial feature extraction
     in image generation tasks.
    
    The study also examined the role of data augmentation in GAN training, finding that while augmentation can 
    introduce useful variability into the training data, it may also lead to optimization challenges if not carefully 
    applied. The final model, trained on downscaled images due to hardware limitations, was able to produce cat images, 
    demonstrating the effectiveness of GANs in image synthesis.
    
    The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how GAN architecture and training strategies influence 
    the quality of generated images, offering insights for future research and practical applications in fields 
    requiring high-quality image generation. The study concludes by suggesting directions for further exploration, 
    including the potential benefits of more advanced GAN variants and higher-resolution training data.
