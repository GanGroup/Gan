# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

## 2023.5.13

● Explorative project
● Practical implementation is given using Tensorflow
● Using this example, implement your own DCGAN for some dataset
● Invent your own GAN analysis (to do together)
● Learn GAN and DCGAN
● Literature review

  ## History

  The concept of GAN was initially developed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in June 2014.

  ## Time plan

  ● Thesis submission: 2 October
  ● Presentation: 27 September (20+5 min)
  ● Whatsup group created
  ● Work plan:
  ○ Learning literature and other sources: 3 weeks
  ○ Running and understanding the tensorflow example: 3 days
  ○ Finding your “own” dataset and implementing it with tensorflow: 2 weeks
  ○ Thinking about additional research questions on the analysis of the obtained
  results, e.g. embedding of the generated images/text and comparing them with
  the training data.Implementing it. 1 month
  ○ Start writing in August. For writing: > 1.5 months
  ● Kai: 18 June in Cork
  ● Jiaxue: 11 August in Cork
  ● Online meetings ~weekly about 1 hour (max 2 hours)
  ● Time shift: +7 for China

  ## Next meeting:

  21 May 10am Irish time using zoom (discussion of GANs and the literature)
  TODO
  ● Github initialisation (KD)
  ● Copy general doc file to github (SY)
  ● Copy PDFs of the papers to github (all)
  ● Read the sources, look for important references (all)
